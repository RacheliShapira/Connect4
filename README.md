Connect Four is a two-player, vertical checkers game.

In the first screen, the players write their names, or leave it as the default, as Player#1 and Player#2, then they take turns dropping their pieces into a seven-column, six-row board. The first player to get their pieces into four slots that are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally contiguous wins the game.
